This is the first major alx project involving python. I will be tasked to clone the AirBnB app but with a few tricks, instead of a dedicated front end platform for users to use, we will have to use the terminal. I am doing this task alone but I will seek help from other poeple and occasionally ChatGPT

I will provide further instructions as I come along ;)
